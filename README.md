# Tammy here is the first portfolio page that I have made for myself.  I have a long way to go but the courage to keep going. I know I get a little "dumb" for people, but having a couple of mini strokes in your life can do that to someone.  I keep going, it's the olny place I can go. Giving up isn't in my vocabulary. I haven't learned it "Yet".
